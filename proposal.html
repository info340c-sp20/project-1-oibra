            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <p>
                I've been a TA for CSE 14X for the past two years (I am not currently), and in that time I've seen a lot of the student pain points for that class. I'm also on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/udub">r/udub</a>, so I've seen what students complain the most about there. The most common complaint/warning about the 14X series is the harsh internal grading on style. A lot of the course staff feel that we are pretty clear and give a lot of resources to students on writing "well-styled" (by our standards) code, but students' sentiments towards the courses would suggest otherwise, that they still feel that grading code internally on style is not entirely transparent or fair. I know this isn't some <strong>big</strong> societal issue, but I want to be an educator, and I hate seeing students struggling with something; I want to do what I can to help them.

            <h3>Existing Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                A few attempts have been made at providing resources to students in the CSE 14X series to help make our requirements on style more clear. These have included:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Some instructors include a page of <a target="_blank" href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/20wi/homework/style.shtml">General Style Deductions</a> where they list new items that will be graded on internally that week.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Both courses always include style guides defining what good Java style means for that class, usually in the form of a <a target="_blank" href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/20sp/homework/style2.pdf">PDF document found on the site</a>, although 143's has been updated to now be integrated with their course website for this quarter (see <a target="_blank" href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143/20sp/style/">here</a>). As a personal project, I developed an <a target="_blank" href="https://staff.washington.edu/oibra/style-guide/">updated web-based style guide for CSE 142</a>, which I hoped would make the style information more accessible to students (this version of the guide has never been published to students, so I have no idea of its effectiveness compared to other versions).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        14X students are provided the <a target="_blank" href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143/19au/indent.html">Indenter Tool</a>, a tool which students can paste their code into which will output a correctly indented version of their code (most Java IDE's also have functionality to correctly indent code, including the one used by CSE 14X, but this is not advertised well/at all to students). The Indenter Tool seems to be the one that gets the most/best use; after the first few weeks of students being pointed to this tool after making indentation mistakes, indentation mistakes tend to drop a lot.
                        <blockquote>
                            It is not entirely clear if this effect is actually due to student use of the Indenter Tool or if it's a side effect of students becoming more comfortable writing Java code. I am going to work under the assumption of the former.
                        </blockquote>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                There also exist some general online tools, often called code "beautifiers" or "formatters", that take in Java code and output "beautified" code (<a target="_blank" href="https://codebeautify.org/javaviewer/cb8a77e0">example</a>). I believe that these don't cover the proposed territory of my application for the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    These applications are fully undescriptive of what code standards they are beautifying the code based on. At best, this means students have no idea what the issue with their code was. At worst, the new code goes against the 14X style guidelines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These applications provide no educational value. They fix code with no explanation of why the code was bad, so students will become reliant on the tool fixing their code as opposed to using the tool to <em>learn</em> to write better-styled code.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>
                I am going to create an online Java linter which users will be able to submit code into and will output the style issues with the code and suggestions for how to fix them, based on the CSE 14X code style guidelines. Users will be able to submit code through either text input (similar to the indenter tool shown above) or file upload, and then the application will output information about the style issues in the code with suggestions about how to fix them, teaching users what the style issues in their code are and how to fix them without doing the work for the users, helping them to do a better job of identifying issues and understanding how to fix them without the tool in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intended audience is primarily CSE 14X students, but a well-functioning version of this tool should function as a good resource for any novice Java learner to learn to write well-styled code. A perfect version of this application used by a student for the full quarter, in my mind, would no longer have a use to the student by the time they complete the course.
            </p>
            <blockquote>Much like the dating app Hinge, this application is designed to make itself useless (this isn't sponsored or anything, I've just been seeing a lot of Hinge ads lately and their slogan is kinda applicable here).</blockquote>
