# Project 1: Java Style Linter
## Author: Omar Ibrahim

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool. This web app will function as an educational Java linter that checks the style of users' input Java code and inform users of what the style errors are with suggestions on how to fix them. This app will be built around the style guidelines for UW CSE 14X (Intro CS1 & 2 at UW) with those students as the primary audience, but should be a helpful resource for any novice Java learners.
